Final Project for cs7250 -- Data Visualization
Seth Pate, Alberto Ceballos Arroyo, Tonia Wang

This app is currently hosted at https://pretty-transformers.herokuapp.com.
There's a detailed 'about' section there.

If you're impressed by how slow Heroku loads things, you can try running it locally.
Do a `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `python app.py`, and you should
get the page up locally.

Enjoy!
